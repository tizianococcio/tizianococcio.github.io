Hello! My name is Tiziano, I practice software engineering and have a passion for music and sound. I enjoy experimenting with different flavors in my coffee (ginger is my current favorite), and I always keep my toothbrush on the sink. After years of working in the field, I recently graduated with a degree in Artificial Intelligence, with a thesis focused on spiking neural networks.

Alongside the professional career, my journey led me to explore film photography, medicine, music, travelling, meditation, and literature. It can be challenging to juggle so many passions, but I find that each one brings a unique perspective and enriches my life in different ways.

I find beauty in software engineering, particularly when I see the opportunity to use machines and algorithms creatively. Knowing that everything is a journey, I do have two main ideal objectives in my life: always trying to think deeply about anything, always trying to be compassionate, combining rationality and emotion. To say this, I find the words of Dante Alighieri beautifully expressive and concise: *luce intellettual, piena d'amore* (Paradiso, Canto XXX), which is [translated](https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/paradiso/paradiso-30/) as *light of the intellect, light filled with love*.

If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to connect! Let's grab a coffee (with or without ginger) and chat.
