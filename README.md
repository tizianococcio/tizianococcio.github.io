Repository for my GitHub Pages site. This is a Jekyll site, so you can run it locally with the following commands:

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --lsi
````

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, so you can see it at https://tizianococcio.github.io.

I used the beautiful [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.
